#Photovoltaic Panel Simulator

The developed simulator operates in an extremely simple manner. It comes with a project developed in Python (it is necessary to have a Python interpreter installed on the device that will run the software) and a mobile application in .apk format. Simply execute the file to install the application.

The application offers the following functionalities for the user to send solar radiation (W/m²) and temperature (ºC) data. The application then transmits this data via the MQTT protocol to the device running the software. The software can calculate power and IV curves based on either temperature, radiation, or both, allowing the user to decide the most suitable option.
